Revision history for App::bmkpasswd

1.04  2012-06-09

  Fix a broken test on systems missing SHA support.

  More consistent POD between bmkpasswd(1) and App::bmkpasswd

1.03  2012-06-08

  croak() if specified work cost factor is not numeric.
  
  croak() on unknown types.

  Clean up an old check that is no longer relevant; have_sha() will now 
  do the Right Thing if Crypt::Passwd::XS is missing, so we don't need 
  to check if someone was stupidly futzing with package variables.

1.02 2012-06-08

  A couple of "derp" typo/style cleanups; non-fatal but aggravating my 
  OCD.

1.01 2012-06-08

  - Use Try::Tiny rather than raw block eval
  - Use strictures
  - Improved tests

1.00 2012-05-23

  - Minor cleanups, 1.00

0.05 2012-04-07

Minor fixes:

  - Include . / in standard salt possibles (MD5/SHA)
  - croak() rather than die() from bmkpasswd.pm
